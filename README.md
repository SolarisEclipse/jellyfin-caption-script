# jellyfin-caption-script
Initial Commit : 

This is a script that allows anyone to look up the path of a
Jellyfin Movie repository and upload an SRT or whatever to that folder. 

It's recommended that anyone who uses this script has a basic understanding
of file/folder path structure, sshfs, and smb.

Youtube is your friend.
